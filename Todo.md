VSC_Open.sh: This script opens a Virtual System Control (VSC) partition on a physical disk and makes it accessible as a device node on Linux. To achieve similar functionality in Python, you would need to use a library or module that provides access to low-level disk I/O operations on the target operating system.
VSC_Read.sh: This script reads data from a specific VSC partition on a physical disk and writes it to a file. To implement similar functionality in Python, you could use a library or module that provides access to low-level disk I/O operations, such as the os module or the io module.
VSC_Write.sh: This script writes data from a file to a specific VSC partition on a physical disk. To implement similar functionality in Python, you could again use a library or module that provides access to low-level disk I/O operations.
